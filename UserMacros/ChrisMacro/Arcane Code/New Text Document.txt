Arcane Code
The following macro programs store processes that I find to be rather arcane and difficult to remember. When that happens, why not just store the process in a macro!

    AddFormatLib - Adds a format library to the SAS options without overwriting the libraries already specified.
    AddSASAuto - Adds a SAS autocall macro library to the SAS options without overwriting the libraries already specified.
    ColorLog - Adds a message to the log in color, either Red, Blue, or Green.
    GetOption - Obtains a SAS option and optionally stores it in a global macro variable.
    JunkLog - Turns the log off by sending it to a dummy file and turns it back on to the default. Useful for masking a process that you do not want to show up int he log.
    ViewFormat - Opens a format as a data set for easier viewing. Why isn't this the default behavior in SAS?
