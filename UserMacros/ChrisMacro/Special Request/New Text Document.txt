		ConditionCount.sas
Download 	Evaluate a condition using a data step and output one message if any records meet the condition. The message contains the number of observations that meet the condition. NOTE: Use mnemonics for operators such as = (i.e., EQ) as the macro processor will interpret it as a keyword argument instead of a condition.  	1k 	v. 4 	Dec 29, 2010 7:57 AM 	Chris Swenson
