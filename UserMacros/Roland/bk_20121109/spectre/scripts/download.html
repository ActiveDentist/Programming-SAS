<h1>
Spectre (Clinical) Download</h1></center>

<p><br>The <b>clinical reporting system</b> named Spectre can be downloaded
as three zip files. If you are creating an e-book on your PC or laptop
then create a directory "<b>spectre</b>" under your <b>C:</b> drive and
create two directories "<b>macros</b>" and "<b>scripts</b>" <b><i>under
</i></b>the
"<b>spectre</b>" directory. Unzip the files in the relevant directory after
you have downloaded them. Please note that most of the html pages have
web counter code embedded in the html (even if you do not see a counter
on the page) and when viewed on your PC or laptop as an e-book, these pages
will attempt to connect to the Internet. I do not know a way to prevent
this.
<p>If you are <b>installing</b> Spectre on Unix or Linux then you will
maybe only need the <b>macros</b> and <b>scripts</b> zip files (in which
case download these to a directory of your own choosing) and will keep
the documentation on the Internet. This is recommended as although the
macros and scripts will have change freezes applied to them, this will
not be the case for the html documentation. If you are installing Spectre
on Unix or Linux then you will not need all the files in the macros and
scripts zip files. The installation instructions give details on how to
exclude those files.
