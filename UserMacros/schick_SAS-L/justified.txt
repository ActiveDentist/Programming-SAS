This oughta be in the FAQ (if we had an FAQ).


It is very easy to left, center, or right justify titles in ordinary SAS
output. You just have to blank fill the title to the same width as the 
current linesize.

For the sake of demonstration, I will set the linesize to 32 columns, 
generally it is set between 78 and 132 columns:


      OPTIONS LINESIZE=32;
      TITLE1 '12345678901234567890123456789012';
      TITLE2 'LEFT JUSTIFIED                  ';
      TITLE3 '                 RIGHT JUSTIFIED';
      TITLE4 'LEFT SIDE             RIGHT SIDE';
      TITLE5 'CENTERED';


It works for footnotes too.

Do note that the SAS date and Page number that appears on the
upper right side of the page will try to fit itself on the second
title if it won't fit on the first.
